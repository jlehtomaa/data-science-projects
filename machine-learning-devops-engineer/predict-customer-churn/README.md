## Running the analysis (with poetry and pyenv)

Create a new virtual environment using the pyenv virtualenv plugin in python 3.8.8:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.8 predict-customer-churn-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
pyenv activate predict-customer-churn-env
```

Switch to the project folder. Then, install dependencies:

```bash
poetry add $(cat requirements_py3.8.txt)
```

If errors occur, updating the pip for poetry often help: ```poetry run pip install --upgrade pip```.
